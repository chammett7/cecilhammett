# Portfolio Website

## Introduction 
This is a portfolio website I created for both professional and personal usage. The website has many pages including a description about me, my education, software skills and experience, as well as a few links to some of my projects and my hobbies. 

## Website Restrictions
The website is functional on both desktop and mobile; however there are some visibility and sizing restrictions when accessed on a smaller screen. Access the website on a full screen computer to view it's fully functional form.
